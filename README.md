# VO2_submax_equations
Comparisons of some equations to estimate VO2max from submaximal exercise tests. 
This is based on work published in:
Hughes AD, Chaturvedi N. Estimation of Maximal Oxygen Consumption and Heart Rate Recovery Using the Tecumseh Sub-Maximal Step Test and their Relationship to Cardiovascular Risk Factors. Artery Res 2017; 18: 29-35.
& Hughes AD, Chaturvedi N. Corrigendum to "Estimation of maximal oxygen consumption and heart rate recovery using the Tecumseh sub-maximal step test and their relationship to cardiovascular risk factors" [Artery Research 18 (June 2017) 29-35]. Artery Res 2021; 27(1): 51.

Some aspects of the methodology in this publication could have been clearer - as described in some of the manuscripts we used heart rate measured over 30s but this could have been better described in the methods of our paper (hence the corrigendum). 
This repo updates this work to an extent and I hope makes the calculations clearer.
